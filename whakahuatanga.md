Pronunciation Guide

Vowels - Oropuare
The vowel sounds in te reo Māori are split into 'short', 'long', and 'diphthongs' (two vowels together).

The short vowels are pronounced:
a as in cup
e as in egg
i as in eat
o as in for
u as in to

The long vowels are pronounced:
ā as in car
ē as in measure
ī as in heel
ō as in your
ū as in roof

When two vowels appear next to each other (a diphthong), they keep their individual sounds, but run them together.

The consonant sounds in te reo Māori are:
h, k, m, n, ng, p, r, t, w, wh

ng as in winger
wh as in firm
r is rolled - there is no equivalent English sound, but the closest is dd as in udder or puddle

Note: there is no s in the Māori alphabet, therefore we do not make a plural by adding s as in most English cases. For example more than one tui is not tuis, it's just tui - like sheep!
